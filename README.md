This is my first project baes on the Ecommerce bussiness.

📊 E-Commerce Data Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce operational data to uncover insights related to customer behavior, product performance, sales trends, and market growth opportunities. The analysis aims to support data-driven decision-making for improving operational efficiency, increasing revenue, and enhancing customer experience across regions and platforms.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

Significant effort was invested in preparing the dataset to ensure accurate analysis:

Standardized date formats (order date, delivery date) and normalized column names

Removed currency symbols (₹, $, etc.) and percentage signs from numeric fields

Handled missing values in key attributes such as customer ID, product ID, and purchase amount

Converted incorrect data types (sales amount, quantity, discount) from text to numeric formats

These steps improved data consistency and reliability for downstream analysis.

🔍 Key Insights
Customer Behavior

Peak shopping activity occurs during weekends and festive seasons

Repeat customers contribute a significant portion of total revenue

Product Performance

A small subset of products (top ~20%) generates the majority of sales

High-performing categories include Electronics, Fashion, and Home Essentials

Sales & Revenue Trends

Consistent month-over-month sales growth

Flash sales and discount campaigns drive noticeable revenue spikes

Cart Abandonment

High cart abandonment rate (60–70%) observed during checkout

Primary causes include high shipping costs and complex checkout processes

Geographical Trends

Metro cities contribute the highest sales volume

Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities show increasing demand and growth potential

Regional preferences influence product demand

Marketing & Customer Segmentation

Email and social media campaigns show high engagement with varied conversion rates

Personalized recommendations improve click-through and purchase rates

High-value customers identified using purchase frequency and transaction value

📈 Conclusions

The analysis highlights strong seasonal buying patterns, dependence on top-performing products, and significant revenue opportunities in emerging markets. While metro regions dominate sales, improving customer experience and targeting new regions can drive sustainable growth. High cart abandonment remains a critical challenge impacting conversion rates.
